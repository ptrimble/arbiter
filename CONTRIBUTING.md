# How To Contribute

Have a new Arbiter driver? Found a bug that you want fixed? Having trouble running the tests?

## Dependencies

To run the full test suite, you'll need libzmq installed on your machine. Please see the zeromq site for instructions on how to install this.

## Tests

We expect all patches we receive to be tested. A pull request without tests (either new tests for a new feature, or modified tests for a bug) will most likely be rejected.
